title: Week 6: Halfway There
---

We had a discussion on diversity and culture within the tech industry on Monday. It got me thinking about another topic that has to do with work culture in the startup industry: the alleged 80-hour work week. 

Gender equity and diversity are worthy and needed topics of discussion in practically any workplace, to be certain. Another topic I wish was addressed more openly is that of greed. Especially as it pertains to human capital and the pervasive expectation that if you work in technology, you're going to have to put in ridiculously long hours. Who decided this? And why does everyone talk about it so matter-of-factly? Why do people accept it so readily? 

If I felt like I had more time to do so, I'd research whether being totally over-worked, exhausted, and living without balance is somehow conducive to learning and the acquisition of new skills, productivity, accomplishments, etc. But instead, I'm going to go out on a big, sturdy-looking limb and say *no*. No, there is *no way* that those conditions benefit people in any other way than monetarily. Having a foosball table at the office does not make a customary 12+ hour work day acceptable. It just doesn't.

I value my personal life. I value sleep. And balance. Sorry not sorry.

Don't get me wrong, I can give startups the benefit of the doubt to some degree. Yes, I understand that if they truly are *just* "starting up" that cash flow is an issue and hiring loads of people to get all the necessary work done is not going to be an option. But I've heard of plenty of companies that are well out of the starting blocks, yet continue to work their tech talent to death. I'm not even going to mention high turnover rates. Duh...

I find myself questioning the intensity of code school, too. It seems that programs like the one I'm in are specifically designed to prepare students for this over-worked lifestyle (no surprise that they're often referred to as "bootcamps"). But why? Why can't this aspect of tech workplace culture be examined (i.e., *rejected*) a little more readily? Why not, for example, instead of a 12-week program, make it 14 weeks long, dial down the intensity and let people experience normal-ish evenings and weekend with their families? For whose benefit are people trained to expect to work unmanageable hours? I think, at the very least, it's a discussion worth having.

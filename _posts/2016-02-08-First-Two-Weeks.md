title: Imposters
---

In the weeks leading up to applying to Omaha Code School, and during the time in between interviewing and hearing back about results, I spent a lot of time wondering if I would even be accepted. When I wasn't thinking about that, I was speculating (i.e., worrying) about what would happen if I <i>did</i> get in. Could I cut it? Web development is an entirely new field for me. I thought that there must be plenty of bright people who've been toying around with code for ages, who would be much better qualified for this sort of thing. While that's true for maybe a few of my classmates, there are a lot of people here who, like me, are brand new to the field.

Despite being in good company, my worries began to grow from Day 1, when I quickly realized I was ill-prepared for the coding tasks that week. I was not surprised to learn (and perhaps somewhat relieved to find out) that there is a name for this phenomenon of feeling inadequate, despite one's obvious capabilities: Imposter Syndrome. It's a term my classmates use a lot, generally as a note-to-self to stop freaking out about how stupid they feel. 

Feeling like such a great imposter myself, I read up on the subject, particularly as it pertains to those in the tech industry, and stubmled across some interesting commentary and images from a software engineer and writer named <a href="http://alicialiu.me/">Alicia Liu</a>. In <a href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/overcoming-impostor-syndrome-bdae04e46ec5#.ti4gk7qw0">a 2013 article</a> she wrote for <a href="https://medium.com/">Medium</a>, she provided this visual depiction of imposter syndrome:

Makes sense. It's a good way to reframe things when you're feeling mega-stupid because you have classmates who can <i>just code things</i>. And you <i>can't</i>. However, in 2015, Liu wrote another article for Medium called "<a href="https://medium.com/@aliciatweet/you-don-t-have-impostor-syndrome-126e4c4bdcc#.cfyx1pl2p">"You Don't Have Imposter Syndrome"</a>:

Gets right to the point, no?

My advice for others who are considering going down the path of web development is to try and keep their inner-critic under control. Accept that, as a newcomer, you will indeed know very little compared to people who have been at it for years, or even just months. But don't forget that, when compared to your newcomer peers, while it might seem like they're way ahead of you on certain things (or <i>everything</i>), perhaps they just know different stuff than you do. Or their style of learning is such that code school suits them perfectly, while you may have to spend extra time figuring out how to adapt.

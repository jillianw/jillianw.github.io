title: Stress and Whining and Getting Used to Things
---

Man, code school sucks sometimes. 

This week was hard. All the weeks have been hard, but this last week -- the fourth week -- was especially so. (I say that after every week...) 

My ego is bruised. My brain is tired. My social life is... <i>social life?</i> What's <i>that?</i> I've watched ONE HOUR of television in the last week. I'm <i>dying</i>. I <i>need</i> television. Have I listened to Serial? NO, I HAVEN'T LISTENED TO SERIAL.

When was the last time I vacuumed the stairs? Or scrubbed the bathroom sink? Ew.

I knew code school was going to be a major time commitment. And I'm getting used to putting in long hours every day, with basically no days off. I'm getting used to turning down social invites, turning down offers for my band to play shows, turning down the volume on the TV until my husband gives up and watches things on his iPad with headphones on. I'm getting used to neglecting basic everyday activities like cooking food and keeping things as tidy as I'd like to. But it definitely starts to wear on me. I'm maintaining my sanity through meditation and occasional outdoor excursions. I think.

Perhaps more difficult than anything is adjusting the new reality that I am not a star student. I'm getting by and learning at my own pace, but I'm certainly not one of the most gifted students in class. This is a tough transition for me. Since childhood I've been great in school. High school valedictorian! 4.0 on my Master's degree! Aced that test without really trying! Those days are over. This stuff is \*NEW\* for me, and it is complicated as hell. It gets a little clearer every day, but only a little, and sometimes it's hard to wait for tomorrow for that extra little something.

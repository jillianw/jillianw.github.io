title: How We're Supposed to Ask for Help with Our Work
---

When asking for help with our work, we push any applicable code to GitHub and include a link to our pull request in a help channel in Slack. We are supposed to describe clearly what we're trying to accomplish with specific parts of our code, and then describe what is (or isn't) happening instead. Note any applicable error messages and what those might mean.

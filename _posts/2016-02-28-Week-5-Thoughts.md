title: Week 5 Was Way Better Than Week 4...
---

The week started off rough with a lot of headaches and losing precious time on a new project, but thankfully some concepts finally started to click, too. I'm still slow, but I'm understanding what we've learned so far a whole lot better than before. On Monday, I thought, well, I'm just not going to get this stuff, am I? It's just not going to happen. Time to quit! And then all of a sudden on Wednesday, things just made sense. I'd think it was bizarre, but the same thing happened to me a lot when I was growing up, specifically when learning music. I took years of piano lessons, and sometimes I just couldn't play something fluidly. Couldn't make my hands do it fast enough or get the syncopation down, or the reach was too much for my stupid little hands or whatever else. If I would walk away from it, nine times out of ten, I'd come back the next day playing it with no problems at all. Muscle memory I guess they call that. Simultaneously gratifying and infuriating. I hate waiting.



**Hack Your Learning, Con't...**

* 12-hour Sudafed (the behind-the-counter stuff...) is, like, Adderall Junior. Can't focus because you're overwhelmed and confused? Also have sinus problems? Great. Take some code-enhancing drugs. Tapping your feet all day long is okay. Quivering all over makes you seem cool and interesting. Eye of the tiger.

* If I take a lunch break I can't get back into the swing of things very easily. Better to just power through. 

* Migraines are the ultimate de-railer. No progress will be made while migraining. Prevent them at all costs. ALL. COSTS.
